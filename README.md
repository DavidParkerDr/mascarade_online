# mascarade_online
Mascarade is a fun card game of bluff and memory where your identity becomes increasingly difficult to track as you and the other players swap (or not) their roles.

It was a physical game that I enjoyed playing with my board game group before the pandemic lockdown of 2020 made me shun their stale air.

At the end of October 2020 I ran the Three Thing Game jam and I thought that I could double up on the usefulness of my time. Here is the itch.io submission for the game jam: https://davidparkerdr.itch.io/mascarade-online

So I figured I would make an online version that we could all play together whilst remaining safely behind our screens and several kilometres of air barrier.

One major limitation at the moment is that there is no handling for concurrent games. This means that one single game can exist per instance of the game server. This kind of works ok if I invite people to play with me, but is a bit restrictive generally. I may come back to this.

Feel free to fork and update; I'll even consider pull requests.
